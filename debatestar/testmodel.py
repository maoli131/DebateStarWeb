    'fs_raw': 'So, let me start out by saying, is capitalism perfect? No, it’s clearly not. It never will be. Human beings are not perfect; human beings are always going to make mistakes. Human nature is probably selfish, probably greedy. However, I"ll put this challenge to our opponents, and I"ll also ask the audience this. This is the best time to ever be alive in the entire history of humanity. I challenge to tell me, if you could live another time in the past that’s better than right now, tell me when we get into the Q&A. Is capitalism a blessing? Well, you can’t answer that until you say, “Compared to what?” Compared to what? Is it a blessing compared to the past? I’m going to show you that it was. Is it a blessing compared to its only modern rival, socialism? Another challenge I"ll put forth; there have been 40 socialistic experiments countries have done in the last 100 years. Every one of them has failed. There has never been the answer. It’s been tried, and it fails every time. It’ll always fail; it’s deeply flawed. So, to my opponents, if you have an example of a successful, prosperous socialistic country that is ending poverty, tell us, because if you do, maybe I"ll stop being a capitalist. So, defining capitalism is going to take too long. I’m going to say I prefer the word “economic freedom.” There’s not a perfect capitalistic country in the world, and there’s not a perfect example of a socialistic country in the world. North Korea probably comes closest to it -- total government control. So, we’re all kind of on a continuum here. All right, so here’s a factoid for you tonight. Ninety-seven percent of all the wealth the humanity has created in the entire history of our race has occurred in the last 250 years: 97 percent. Here, you can see what’s happened as capitalism took off. The GDP per capita raced up. The economic success of capitalism is unprecedented in the history of the world. Two hundred years ago, the world’s economy was at the present level of Sierra Leone, and 94 percent of the people were poor. Since then, the per capita globally has increased by over 10X; it’s increased 24X in the United States, 41X in Hong Kong, and 75X in South Korea, 23 percent just since 1960. Here’s the 26 most economically free places in the world. Hong Kong is one, Singapore is two, the United States is number 12. Here are the six least economically free places in the world; they’re all socialistic. The Nordic countries; they are capitalist. I want to take this one off the table. They have very high degrees of economic freedom. The United States -- in fact, you can see they’re all about equivalent to the United States. The Swedish model -- I could have done the Denmark model -- Sweden created most of its wealth back when it was strongly capitalistic in the early part of the 20th century. In the 1960s, they implemented a lot of socialistic policies; economic freedom declined, and so did their prosperity. Now, since then, Sweden has cut back on their government tremendously. Their corporate tax rate is 22 percent. They tried wealth taxes and got rid of them; they have 0 percent inheritance taxes, and they have educational vouchers for all their children. Sweden now ranks number 19 in the world in economic freedom. They"re clearly capitalistic, with a strong social welfare component. Let’s look at economic freedom and income per capita. You can see that mostly free -- the more economically free you are, the richer your country is. If you"re going to be poor, be poor in a rich country, because you are going to have more money if you"re in a rich country. Declining global poverty; this may be the most important slide I"m going to show you. You can see that absolute poverty -- if you go back 200 years ago, 94 percent of the people alive lived on less than $2 a day, 94 percent. 85 percent lived on less than $1 a day. Now, 8 percent live on less than $2 a day. Life expectancy for most of the history of the human race was 30. Now it"s in -- getting into the middle and upper 70’s. If you go back 200 years ago, 90 percent of everyone alive was illiterate. That"s down to 14 percent now. Capitalism is not increasing inequality of income. This is going to be something we"ll talk about tonight, I"m certain. You can see the U.S. income distribution has been relatively, fairly constant. It"s changed, but almost since the founding of the Republic. Very close together. This is very important, because the poorest households in America over the last 50 years, there are 20 percent less of them. There"s fewer in the middle income level as well. The highest income level has more than tripled. Now, almost 27 -- 29 percent of the households make over $100,000. Look at the economic freedom. The -- if you"re going to be poor, the income equality is highest in -- it"s highest in the high-income areas. Wealth isn"t the problem. Poverty is the problem. Wealth doesn"t cause poverty. Poverty is the natural default condition of the human race. Capitalism is creating wealth not for a few, but for billions of people. The problem is not that there"s an unequal distribution of income in this world. There"s an unequal distribution of economic freedom. To seek the causes of poverty -- I"ll end with this. "To seek the "causes" of poverty in this way is to enter into an intellectual dead end, because poverty has no causes. Only prosperity has causes," Jane Jacobs. Capitalism creates prosperity. Thank you very much.',
    'ags_raw': "Well, let's be clear about what the question of this debate was. The question of this debate is,'Is capitalism a blessing?' not,'Was capitalism a blessing?' There's no doubt of the material gains of capitalist development, capitalism, of course, that has existed in a form that has been harnessed and shaped by mass democratic working class movements. After all, the franchise and many of our most treasured basic civil liberties were not gifted to us by capitalists. Around the world, they were fought for and won often by workers movements that had as major parts of their components democratic socialists. So this is actually existing capitalism, and it's a capitalism that has been constantly shaped by anti-capitalist forces. Now, capitalism today has made materially possible the old enlightenment dream of liberty, equality, fraternity. It's made possible a different world, but it's foreclosed its realization. Now, what capitalism has not been able to do is solve two problems that I believe an alternative system could solve. One problem would be a distributional question. So the distributional question is,'How come we have so much immense riches in the world, but so many other people are deprived of the basic necessities that need to fulfill their creative potentials?' whatever that might be. So, the very least we can say,'Capitalism in the United States, for instance, is not enabling people to reach their potential, because it's depriving them of housing, education, healthcare, and all these other core necessities of life.' At the very minimum, we should demand that a different system offer people these access to these things. Now, it is correct, and we'll get to this later -- by the way, my timer isn't working, so I'm -- yeah, but -- Yeah, just give me a hand signal. But we are at a point when we need to say that,'Yes, the Nordic countries have actually achieved certain of these minimums.' We -- if you're born in a Nordic country, you could be assured a much greater chance of reaching your creative potential that you're born in the United States. And we'll get to the nature of this Nordic model and who created the Nordic model later. But the second question’s of power, a question of ownership and distribution. We can't talk about markets when we're talking about capitalism. We can't conflate the two. Markets existed before capitalism, and markets will exist after capitalism. I think there's a -- is an important role for markets to play in a post-capital system for both price calculation questions and for incentives, to motivate each other, to produce efficiently and whatnot. We have to decide, of course, what sphere we want markets in. I think there is no role for the market in the provisioning of basic healthcare. One's ability of access to the same should be a matter of social right. This is in fact something that the government can do well. Now, when it comes to the creation of pencils and all sorts of other consumer goods, it would be a huge mistake to say that we could do this by state planning. And very few socialists propose today that state planning would be necessary in the spheres of consumer goods. So what we're arguing when we're arguing for capitalism is not an argument for -- it's not an argument for some sort of -- a form of growth that's driven by market and for prosperity. What it is an argument for is private ownership and a means of production. So I would argue that what we have in this society today is a society that enables people to reach their creative potentials, people that have access to the means of production. They have access to all sorts of avenues of success, while other people of equal talents are stuck working for them. Now, what would an alternative be? We could collectively run our work places and elect our own management. Now, these self-managed firms would still have to be subjected to forms of discipline. These self-managed firms could compete against each other in the market. They could fail. That's fine, as long as the sectors and spheres that are failing are not core sectors like our healthcare, like our education, like things where we don't believe the market should have any part in. Then that will be fine. But what you're arguing when you're defending capitalism is not a system of productivity based on the market. What you're arguing for is market dependency, the fact that every single sphere of life, the important necessities be driven by market imperatives, and you're defending private ownership of the mean's production. In my alternative, in a democratic socialist alternative, workers would be incentivized to work and contribute to production by, instead of receiving a wage, by receiving a dividend of production. So, what we propose, what we need to aspire to is a form where we no longer have workers and capitalists, when we simply have worker owners. This sort of society would have a bedrock of the de-commodified social safety net. Sweden did not switch towards some socialist model in the 1960s. The Swedish social democrats have been in power since 1930s. The most important date in Swedish social democratic history is 1938 when the basic agreement was formed between labor and capital. The Rehn-Meidner plan, which set up sectoral bargaining, happened in 1952. Over the course of the '20s, '30s, '40s, and '50s, and '60s, Sweden was transformed from an oligarchy, undemocratic country into a vastly prosperous, high-wage economy. This happened because of the workers movement. It happened because of socialists, and it happened against the imperative of private capitalists in the market.",

    'fortext': 'Scientists are now able to isolate genes that relate to specific heath and behavioral tendencies. Society should recognize the critical role our genetics play in our lives. Understanding a child’s propensity for academic achievement can lead to a more inclusive education system and better allocation of resources. Rather than forcing children to engage in subjects for which they have no natural aptitude, schools should embrace genetics in helping students succeed. Acknowledging that genes have such a powerful influence on individuals may result in more sympathy for those who are prone to mental or physical challenges.',
    'againsttext': 'Studies suggest that environmental factors, such as one’s socioeconomic situation, is a more reliable predictor of academic achievement than genes. Further, limiting a child\'s schooling options based on their personal genetics is unfair and unjust in a democratic and free society. As history indicates, suggestions of genetic determinism may lead to harmful social policies. Plus, if individuals believe that their fate is written in their DNA, this could lead to apathy and make conditions they are susceptible to worse.'
